# Guide to add SSH key to Yubikey

This guide is far too simple but it took my quite a good time to achieve what i want

## Goal

To create a ssh key pair and store it on yubikey

### Assumptions

- Yubikey is already prepared and it has FIDO keyset. If FIDO key is not set, you will get errors.How to set this key, i will explain shortly in this document.
- Yubikey manager is installed.
- All libraries which are required for touch setup are also installed.

>Note: guide_youbikey*.md can help you to configure yubikey.

### Preparation

You need yubikey manager. This is not installed by default.

 Step:01 Create ssh key pair

#### Generate SSH Key pair

The most important part of the below command `-O resident`

```bash
‚ùØ ssh-keygen -t ecdsa-sk -O resident -C "$(date +%F) $USER@$HOST"
Generating public/private ecdsa-sk key pair.
You may need to touch your authenticator to authorize key generation.
Enter PIN for authenticator: 
You may need to touch your authenticator again to authorize key generation.
PIN incorrect
Enter PIN for authenticator: 
You may need to touch your authenticator again to authorize key generation.
Enter file in which to save the key (/home/preetam/.ssh/id_ecdsa_sk): 
/home/preetam/.ssh/id_ecdsa_sk already exists.
Overwrite (y/n)? y
Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase): 
Enter same passphrase again: 
Your identification has been saved in /home/preetam/.ssh/id_ecdsa_sk
Your public key has been saved in /home/preetam/.ssh/id_ecdsa_sk.pub
The key fingerprint is:
SHA256:rVY1ArQXzOxbZjLfpGPiZ85EyeSGXP3phtHZUA5hcGc 2024-02-24 preetam@prelite
The key's randomart image is:

```

#### Tips/Recommendations

- my recommendation, do not put a paraphrase to ssh key. This double protection is not required. 

### Add ssh key to the ssh agent

```bash
ssh-add -k
Identity added: /home/preetam/.ssh/id_ecdsa_sk (2024-02-24 preetam@prelite)
Enter passphrase for /home/preetam/.ssh/id_ed25519: 
ssh-add -l
256 SHA256:rVY1ArQXzOxbZjLfpGPiZ85EyeSGXP3phtHZUA5hcGc 2024-02-24 preetam@prelite (ECDSA-SK)

```

with this step you are ready to use this key on this computer. e.g. copy the pub key from ~/.ssh/keyname.pub location and copy it in github
now, you push or pull changes from github, you just need to press touch on yubikey

But to use this key on another computer, you will need to execute the following commands
```bash
  cd ~/.ssh
  ssh-keygen -K (it is capital K) # the mean of K is explained below
  mv id_ecdsa_sk_rk ~/.ssh/id_ecdsa_sk 
```

### Additional Guide (just for reference)

#### Adding the new keys
Now that you have generated a key which you can use, you will need to add it to your current ssh-agent session. You can do that by first starting the agent like so:

```bash
# start the ssh agent, on gui version it starts automatically
eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"

# Then add the key on the YubiKey with the command below:
ssh-add -K

# You can verify that the key was added by listing all the keys available in the current ssh-agent session:
ssh-add -l

# We just added our brand new ssh key temporarily to our current session. If you would like to have it permanently available on the system you can run the command:

ssh-keygen -K

#  This retrieves our ssh key from our YubiKey and puts the private (still protected by YubiKey) and public key in the current working directory. You must now rename them accordingly to id_ed25519_sk and id_ed25519_sk.pub and place them in your ~/.ssh directory so ssh can detect them.

``` 

### Additional keys on yubikeys

```bash

Just use -O application=ssh:Yourtexthere

# So it becomes like this
ssh-keygen -t ed25519-sk -O resident -O application=ssh:Yourtexthere

```bash
