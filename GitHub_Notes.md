# Notes on Github

## What is a pull request?

**Collaboration happens on a pull request.** The pull request shows the changes in your branch to other people and allows people to accept, reject, or suggest additional changes to your branch. 
In a side by side comparison, this pull request is going to keep the changes you just made on your branch and propose applying them to the main project branch.

> A merge is also a kind of commit!

Once your branch has been merged, you don't need it anymore.

Sometimes it can happen if you git diff, you will 'ESC' character. This can be disabled using 'R' in LESS

e.g.

`export LESS='-iRX'`

i - case insenstive search

R - I do not know

X - to avoid clearing screen, after you quit e.g. the man pages

or git specific option 

`git config core.pager 'less -R'`  My preferred choice

Learned this first time. You can rename file directly using git

`git mv oldname newname`

`git log --oneline`

```bash
$ git log --oneline
ddc87ae (HEAD -> master) delete praise.txt
36d2cda renamed message.txt
0dca126 corrected spell
```
`git log --graph`

```bash
git log --graph
