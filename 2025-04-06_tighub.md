# Notes today on Tig

I do not like git word, hence change the word reverse i.e. tig (There is GOD).

## Profi Tips

```bash
git init -b main # <- single step, you init repo and with name main (instead of master)>
git add . && git commit -m "initial commit"

# create branch switch in a single command
git switch -c your-new-branch-name

```

Normally, you can simply remove the remote url but there is nice way to do

`git remote set-url origin git@github.com:your-username/your_repo.git`

(＾◡＾) - older method which I use to use, is git remote remove origin

when you wish to push the changes you made to your fork, [esp when you follow this guide](https://github.com/pmz2025/first-contributions)

```bash
git push -u origin <branchName> # <-- the branch name is created on your remote repo as well

```

[How to clean up things after contribution](https://github.com/firstcontributions/first-contributions/blob/main/docs/additional-material/git_workflow_scenarios/removing-branch-from-your-repository.md)

But I'm repeating here

```bash

git branch main # switching to main branch
git merge <branchname> main # merge branch name with main
git branch -d <branchname> # delete branch from local repo
git push origin --delete <branchname> # delete branch from github

```
